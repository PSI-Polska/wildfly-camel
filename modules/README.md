# WildFly Camel Modules


## Generated module XML files

This project uses the [Smartics Maven Plugin](http://www.smartics.eu/smartics-jboss-modules-maven-plugin/) to generate
XML definitions for each dependency required by the WildFly Camel Subsystem.

The files generated by Smartics are located within the `etc/generated` directory. **_These files should not be edited
under any circumstances_**. Any manual changes will be overwritten each time the build is run. The only approved method
of modifying these files is by altering the Smartics module XML definitions within the `etc/smartics` directory.

## Managed module XML files

Any modules not generated by Smartics are located under the `etc/managed` directory. The module XML files contained in this
location can be edited freely without the risk of changes being overwritten by the Smartics Maven plugin.
