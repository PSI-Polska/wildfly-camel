### OpenShift Origin

Here we follow the instructions on https://www.openshift.org[Try Origin,window=_blank]. We use the https://www.openshift.org/vm[all-in-one VM,window=_blank] approach through a Vagrant VirtualBox VM

After having installed Vagrant and VirtualBox, we run:

```
$ vagrant init openshift/origin-all-in-one
$ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
...
Successfully started and provisioned VM with 2 cores and 5 G of memory.
To modify the number of cores and/or available memory modify your local Vagrantfile
```

We can now access the OpenShift console on: https://10.2.2.2:8443/console[https://10.2.2.2:8443/console,window=_blank]

Configured users are:

```
admin/admin
user/user
```

This should now also allow us to ssh into the VM

```
$ vagrant ssh
Last login: Mon Feb  8 09:06:26 2016 from 10.0.2.2
```

and use the OpenShift command line client.

==== Client Tools

The client tools are available https://10.2.2.2:8443/console/command-line[from the console,window=_blank].

==== Docker access 

The docker deamon running in the Vagrant VM needs be exposed on the network. 
The easiest way to do this is to use the provided https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/blob/master/Vagrantfile[Vagrantfile,window=_blank].

The provided Vagrantfile adds port forwarding, a few docker deamon options and restarts the docker deamon.

```
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8443, host: 8443
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 2375, host: 2375
```

```
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/docker
# Additional startup options for the Docker daemon
OPTIONS="-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
```

```
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

On you local machine, setup a route to the Vagrant VM

```
$ sudo cat /etc/hosts
10.2.2.2    origin
```

and export a few Docker related environment variables for maven builds.

```
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://origin:2375
export DOCKER_IP=origin
```

#### Create an OpenShift project

Here we run a set of WildFly Camel servers on https://www.openshift.org[OpenShift Origin,window=_blank]. 
The target platform is the local OpenShift instance that we created above. 

image::example-rest-design.png[]

The example architecture consists of a set of three high available (HA) servers running REST endpoints. For server replication and failover we use http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes,window=_blank]. 
Each server runs in a dedicated https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/v1.0.0/docs/pods.md[Pod,window=_blank] 
that we access via https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/v1.0.0/docs/services.md[Services,window=_blank].

A project allows us to create deployments, pods, services, routes, etc. under our own custom 'wildfly-camel' namespace.

```
$ oc new-project wildfly-camel
```

##### Create a new application

Now, lets create a new appliction from an existing wildfly-camel based image. 

```
$ oc new-app wildflyext/example-camel-rest -l name=camel
```

and scale it up

```
$ oc scale --replicas=3 dc example-camel-rest
```

After a while you should see the pod running

image::openshift-standalone-pods.png[]

The pods running the JAX-RS endpoints are however not yet exposed to the world.

##### Exposing the container externally

Now, lets expose the HTTP root context of the running wildlfy server.

```
$ oc expose service example-camel-rest -l name=camel
```

From a remote client, you should now be able to access the service like this

http://example-camel-rest-wildfly-camel.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io/rest/greet/hello/Kermit[,window=_blank]

```
Hello Kermit from 172.17.0.8
```
