### Source to Image

WildFly-Camel provides a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-To-Image,window=_blank]
(S2I) https://hub.docker.com/r/wildflyext/s2i-wildfly-camel/[Docker image,window=_blank] which enables you to build reproducable images from source.

#### Example S2I build

First you'll need to download and install the S2I tooling from https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[here,window=_blank].

Then you can build and run a Docker image from source. For example, to build the WildFly-Camel CDI quickstart:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
$ s2i build https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel-examples.git -r 4.4.0 --context-dir camel-cdi wildflyext/s2i-wildfly-camel:4.4.0 wildfly-camel-example-cdi
$ docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 wildfly-camel-example-cdi

From a remote client, you should now be able to access the service like this

http://{ec2-pub-ip}:8080/example-camel-cdi?name=Kermit[,window=_blank]

 Hello Kermit

#### S2I with OpenShift Origin

WildFly-Camel provides an OpenShift builder image, which enables you to do a source to image in OpenShift.

First add the WildFly-Camel S2I ImageStream.

[source,options="nowrap"]
$ oc apply -f http://wildfly-extras.github.io/wildfly-camel/sources/wildfly-camel-imagestream.json

When you select 'Add to Project' in the OpenShift web console you should see a new catalog item named
'wildfly-camel'. Choose this option, then provide the required parameters.

To build the latest release of the WildFly-Camel CDI example you would enter:

[cols="1,2",width="80%"]
|=======
|**Name**| camel-cdi
|**Git Repository URL**| https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel-examples
|**Git Reference**| 4.4.0
|**Context Dir**| camel-cdi
|=======

Click 'Create' to start the build process.

You'll then be able to monitor your application S2I build and deployment in OpenShift. Eventually you should see your application with 1 pod running.

Then to access the application you can browse to the route endpoint URL. For example:

http://camel-cdi-wildfly-camel.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io/example-camel-cdi?name=Kermit
