### CDI

CDI integration is provided by http://camel.apache.org/cdi.html[cdi,window=_blank].

A Context with an associated route can be provided like this

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Startup
@ApplicationScoped
@ContextName("cdi-context")
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
    	from("direct:start").transform(body().prepend("Hi"));
    }
}
----

and consumed like this

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
@Inject
@ContextName("cdi-context")
private CamelContext camelctx;


#### Importing XML DSL configuration

Camel CDI integration enables you to import existing XML DSL files via the `@ImportResource` annotation:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
@ImportResource("camel-context.xml")
class MyBean {
}

It's important to note that the location of the imported file must be present on the deployment classpath. Placing
the file into locations such as `WEB-INF` will not work. However, `WEB-INF/classes` will work fine.
