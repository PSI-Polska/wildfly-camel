### camel-rmi

The http://camel.apache.org/rmi.html[rmi,window=_blank] component binds Exchanges to the RMI protocol (JRMP).

Since this binding is just using RMI, normal RMI rules still apply regarding what methods can be invoked. This component supports only Exchanges that carry a method invocation from an interface that extends the Remote interface. All parameters in the method should be either Serializable or Remote objects.
