### camel-zookeeper-master

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-zookeeper-master/src/main/docs/zookeeper-master-component.adoc[zookeeper-master,window=_blank] component provides a way to ensure only a single consumer in a cluster consumes from a given endpoint; with automatic failover if that JVM dies.

This can be very useful if you need to consume from some legacy back end which either doesnâ€™t support concurrent consumption or due to commercial or stability reasons you can only have a single connection at any point in time.
