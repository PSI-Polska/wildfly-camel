### camel-flink

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-flink/src/main/docs/flink-component.adoc[flink,window=_blank] component provides a bridge between Camel connectors and https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink,window=_blank] tasks. This Camel Flink connector provides a way to route message from various transports, dynamically choosing a flink task to execute, use incoming message as input data for the task and finally deliver the results back to the Camel pipeline.
