### camel-mongodb-gridfs

The https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/mongodb-gridfs-component.html[mongodb-gridfs,window=_blank]
component provides MongoDB GridFS file storage. Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides the file into parts, or chunks, and stores each chunk as a separate document.
