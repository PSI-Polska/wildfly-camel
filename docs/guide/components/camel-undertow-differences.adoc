#### Undertow consumers on {wildfly}

The configuration of camel-undertow consumers on {wildfly} is different to that of standalone Camel. Producer endpoints work as per normal.

On {wildfly}, camel-undertow consumers leverage the default Undertow HTTP server provided by the container. The server is defined within the undertow subsystem configuration. Here's an excerpt of the default configuration from standalone.xml:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:undertow:4.0">
    <buffer-cache name="default" />
    <server name="default-server">
        <http-listener name="default" socket-binding="http" redirect-socket="https" enable-http2="true" />
        <https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" security-realm="ApplicationRealm" enable-http2="true" />
        <host name="default-host" alias="localhost">
            <location name="/" handler="welcome-content" />
            <filter-ref name="server-header" />
            <filter-ref name="x-powered-by-header" />
            <http-invoker security-realm="ApplicationRealm" />
        </host>
    </server>
</subsystem>

In this instance, Undertow is configured to listen on interfaces / ports specified by the http and https socket-binding. By default this is port 8080 for http and 8443 for https.

This has the following implications:

* camel-undertow consumers will only bind to localhost:8080 or localhost:8443
* Some endpoint consumer configuration options have no effect (see below), since these settings are managed by the {wildfly} container

For example, if you configure an endpoint consumer using different host or port combinations, a warning will appear within the server log file. For example the following host & port configurations would be ignored:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
from("undertow:http://somehost:1234/path/to/resource")

[source,options="nowrap"]
[org.wildfly.extension.camel] (pool-2-thread-1) Ignoring configured host: http://somehost:1234/path/to/resource

However, the consumer is still available on the default host & port localhost:8080 or localhost:8443.

##### Configuring alternative ports

If alternative ports are to be accepted, then these must be configured via the {wildfly} subsystem configuration. This is explained in the server documentation:
